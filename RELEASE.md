# Release Process

SpeakType releases are currently **fully automated for the macOS app only**. The script handles version bumping, building, signing, notarization, and uploading for the existing Xcode-based release flow.

Windows release automation does not exist in this repository yet. The Windows roadmap is:

1. portable Windows build for tester validation
2. signed Windows installer after packaging stabilizes
3. optional MSIX work after installer and update workflow maturity

The canonical Windows packaging and migration plan lives in `docs/windows-adaptation/README.md`.

## Release Criteria
Use your judgment, but a release is usually warranted when:
- A user-visible feature or UX improvement lands
- A bugfix affects multiple users or a core flow
- Performance or stability improvements are measurable

For the rest of this document, "release" refers to the current macOS release process unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Prerequisites

### One-Time Setup

**1. Code Signing Certificate**

Verify you have a Developer ID Application certificate:
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
# Should show: "Developer ID Application: ..."
```

**2. App-Specific Password**

Get from [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) → Security → App-Specific Passwords

**Note:** The release script will prompt for this on first run and store it in Keychain.

**3. GitHub CLI** (optional)

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

## Creating a Release

### Auto-Bump Patch Version (Recommended)

```bash
./scripts/release.sh
```

**What happens:**

1. ✅ **Checks for uncommitted changes** - Script fails if you have any uncommitted work
2. ✅ **Auto-bumps patch version** (e.g., 1.0.14 → 1.0.15)
3. ✅ **Updates version in Xcode project** - MARKETING_VERSION and CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION
4. ✅ **Updates CHANGELOG** with release date
5. ✅ **Commits changes locally** - Creates commit and git tag (not pushed yet!)
6. ✅ **Builds and signs the app** - Release configuration with Developer ID
7. ✅ **Creates and signs DMG**
8. ✅ **Submits to Apple for notarization** (~2-5 minutes)
9. ✅ **Staples the notarization ticket**
10. ✅ **Prompts: Push to GitHub?** - Only after successful build
11. ✅ **Prompts: Upload release?** - Only if you pushed

**Total time: ~6-8 minutes**

### Specify Version Manually

```bash
./scripts/release.sh 2.0.0
```

Same workflow, but uses your specified version.

## What You'll Be Asked

The script prompts you at key decision points:

1. **🔼 Push v1.0.15 to GitHub? (y/n)**
   - Asked AFTER successful build/notarization
   - If you say `n`, the script exits and tells you how to undo the local commit
   - Safe to say `n` to test the DMG first

2. **📦 Upload DMG to GitHub releases? (y/n)**
   - Only asked if you said `y` to push
   - Uses GitHub CLI to create the release
   - You can always upload manually later with: `gh release create v1.0.15 SpeakType-1.0.15.dmg --generate-notes`

---

## Verification

After the release, verify on a **different Mac**:

```bash
# Download and open the DMG
# Drag SpeakType.app to Applications
# Double-click to open - should NOT show Gatekeeper warning

# Verify signature
codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/SpeakType.app

# Verify notarization
spctl -a -vv /Applications/SpeakType.app
# Should show: accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Error (401)
```
Error: HTTP status code: 401. Unable to authenticate.
```

**Fix:** Regenerate your app-specific password and re-run the keychain setup:
```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD" \
  --apple-id "mail2048labs@gmail.com" \
  --team-id "PCV4UMSRZX" \
  --password "NEW_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

### Notarization Rejected

Check the submission logs:
```bash
xcrun notarytool history --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD"
# Get the submission ID, then:
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD"
```

Common issues:
- Missing Hardened Runtime entitlement
- Invalid code signature
- Unsigned frameworks/libraries

See [CODESIGNING.md](CODESIGNING.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

### Build Errors

If Xcode build fails:
1. Clean build folder: `xcodebuild clean -scheme speaktype`
2. Verify certificate is valid: `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`
3. Check Xcode version: `xcodebuild -version`

## Notes

- **DMG files are NOT committed to git** - they're large and shouldn't be version-controlled
- **GitHub Actions workflow is disabled** - all release work happens locally
- **Notarization typically takes 2-5 minutes** - Apple's servers process the app
- **The DMG is stapled** - notarization ticket embedded, works offline
- **Windows packaging is not automated yet** - track packaging direction in `docs/windows-adaptation/README.md`

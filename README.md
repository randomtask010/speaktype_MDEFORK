## What is SpeakType?

SpeakType is a **privacy-first, offline voice dictation tool**. The upstream app is macOS-first, and this fork is actively adapting the core dictation workflow for Windows user testing while keeping local/offline transcription as the baseline requirement.

- **Privacy First** - Zero data leaves your Mac
- **Lightning Fast** - Optimized for Apple Silicon
- **Works Everywhere** - Any app, any text field
- **Open Source** - Audit every line of code yourself

### Fork status: Windows adaptation

- macOS app remains the primary production implementation.
- Windows adaptation work and backlog live in [`docs/windows-adaptation/README.md`](docs/windows-adaptation/README.md).
- Runnable Windows MVP prototype lives in [`windows-prototype/`](windows-prototype/README.md).
- Support and user-testing guidance for Windows is included in the Windows docs.

## Installation

### Requirements (macOS app)

- macOS 13.0+ (Ventura or newer)
- Apple Silicon (M1+) recommended
- 2GB available storage (for AI models)

### Download (macOS app)

**[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/karansinghgit/speaktype/releases/latest)**

1. Download `SpeakType.dmg`
2. Drag **SpeakType** to **Applications**
3. Grant Microphone + Accessibility + Documents Folder permissions
4. Download an AI model from Settings → AI Models

Press `fn` to start dictating.

### Windows adaptation (this fork)

For Windows setup, runtime options, troubleshooting, and user-testing checklist:

- [`docs/windows-adaptation/README.md`](docs/windows-adaptation/README.md)
- [`windows-prototype/README.md`](windows-prototype/README.md)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karansinghgit/speaktype.git
cd speaktype
make build && make run
```

---

## Usage

1. Press hotkey (`fn` by default)
2. Speak your text
3. Release hotkey
4. Text appears!

**Tips:**
- Speak naturally - Whisper handles accents well
- Say punctuation: "comma", "period", "question mark"
- Best results with 3-10 second clips

---

## Development

```bash
make build          # Build debug
make run            # Run app
make clean          # Clean build
make test           # Run tests
make dmg            # Create DMG installer
```

### Current Issues

⚠️ When loading a model for the first time / switching to another model, there is a startup delay of 30-60 seconds. 

So the first transcription will appear ultra slow, but it will go back to instantaneous dictation right after it's warmed up. 

### Windows adaptation development notes

- The Makefile targets in this repository are macOS/Xcode-oriented.
- Windows adaptation currently progresses through the Python MVP in `windows-prototype/` and the backlog in `docs/windows-adaptation/README.md`.
